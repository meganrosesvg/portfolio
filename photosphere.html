      <div class="text-block-7 large-image">User flows were created to <strong>show how users would realistically work their way through Photosphere</strong>. This helped me determine what pages the site would need to have and would not need, and <strong>helped me to create a sitemap </strong>for Photosphere as well. The biggest challenge here was simply <strong>making sure the flows contained all necessary actions and options necessary for MVP.</strong><br></div><img src="images/sketch-flow.jpg" alt="user flow phone" srcset="images/sketch-flow-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/sketch-flow-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/sketch-flow-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/sketch-flow-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/sketch-flow-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/sketch-flow.jpg 2378w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 64vw, (max-width: 991px) 66vw, 657.9861450195312px" class="image-6"><img src="images/digital-flows.png" alt="" class="image-12">

      <div class="div-block-4 top-margin">

      <div class="text-block-7">I tested three users - <strong>some remotely and some in person</strong>. This enlightened me to some <strong>issues surrounding the “Upload” function and sign-in pages</strong>. After thorough testing and user feedback, I was able to <strong>make a plan for editing Photosphere</strong> further to relieve it of its kinks.

      <div class="div-block-4 top-margin">
        <p class="paragraph-7">MAJOR TAKEAWAYS: The organize aspect was lumped in with the upload option, which seemed a bit sticky and incomplete. The question was asked: How would one be able to move a photo between albums after uploading? Additionally, users were becoming stuck on location of sign up button on the main page. User testing was invaluable in further iterations.</p>

      <div class="text-block-7">This project was<strong> incredible to direct from concept to interactive, high fidelity prototype</strong>. A big takeaway from working on this is that “Test early and often” is no joke. <strong>I would have started testing even earlier, and would have tested more.</strong> I learned that just because I can create all icons and assets from scratch, doesn’t  mean that I should. <strong>Time is a big factor</strong>. I also learned that there is a resource online for almost anything. And that <strong>testing users is more than just listening to their words</strong>, but also reading their body language and <br>watching their process intensely. <br></div><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ajHESkkGQmpgy2c3dxLqLy9k/Photosphere?node-id=229%3A1150" class="link-block-2 w-inline-block"><img src="images/figma-button.png" alt="figma button" width="137" class="image-7 image-11"></a></div>
