      <div class="text-block-8">The SWOT analysis helped me to determine these companies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Some key takeaways that Photosphere could benefit from were: <br></div>
      <p class="paragraph-4">• SmugMug offers a free trial for two weeks, then no free options. Photosphere will offer a great free option.<br>• SmugMug’s logo isn’t spectacularly memorable or strong. Photosphere will have a memorable, strong logo.<br>• Flickr’s icons do not have words to go along, which can be confusing. Photosphere’s icons will have words.<br>• Flickr autoloads when scrolling. Reaching the footer feels impossible. Photosphere’s interface will not autoload.<br>• Google Drive has strong, simple, and bold branding. Photosphere will have strong, simple branding as well.<br>• Google Drive is not specific to photography. Photosphere will be specific to photography.<br></p>
      <div class="text-block-7">If I were to do anything differently, I would analyze one last photography-specific site. <br>I would also try to tap into SmugMug’s portfolio-style presentation for professional photographers.<br></div><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-kfUgn_Y0eUqouRGkngO9RO4nfsrCF0fe8HUL6tWU9U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="button-2 w-button">VIEW ANALYSIS</a></div>

      <p class="paragraph-5">• The organize aspect was lumped in with the upload option, which seemed a bit sticky and incomplete.<br>• The question was asked: How would one be able to move a photo between albums after uploading?<br>• Users had positive comments on the logo and visuals.<br></p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YUO_CHNZJTHX1e-UR8UHQfr5mihIP9WPg_opNEvUcEE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="button-5 w-button">VIEW ANALYSIS</a></div>

      <div class="text-block-7">At this point I began mindmapping, and finally came up with a name that suited the service: Photosphere. I selected a color palette that reflected the trustworthy, bright and sunny nature of the brand. And I began sketching a logo concept. After sketching, I used Adobe Illustrator to digitize many concepts. Through preference testing I was able to iterate further, and users helped Photosphere realize it’s perfect, final logo.<br></div><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ajHESkkGQmpgy2c3dxLqLy9k/Photosphere?node-id=229%3A1150" target="_blank" class="button-5 w-button">VIEW BRANDING</a></div>

      <h1 class="heading-3">CONCLUSION</h1>
      <h3 class="heading-11">WOULD I HAVE DONE THINGS THE SAME?</h3>
      <div class="text-block-7">This project was incredible to direct from concept to interactive, high fidelity prototype. A big takeaway from working on this is that “Test early and often” is no joke. I would have started testing even earlier, and would have tested more. I learned that just because I can create all icons and assets from scratch, doesn’t  mean that I should. Time is a big factor. I also learned that there is a resource online for almost anything. And that testing users is more than just listening to their words, but also reading their body language and <br>watching their process intensely. <br></div><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ajHESkkGQmpgy2c3dxLqLy9k/Photosphere?node-id=229%3A1150" class="link-block-2 w-inline-block"><img src="images/figma-button.png" alt="figma button" width="137" class="image-7 image-11"></a></div>
