Keeping the brand’s personality in mind, I drew up rough logos then digitized the strongest. Through preference testing, I ended up with NaySure’s logo. <strong>The color palette was also tested with users</strong>, and after two tests, they firmly <strong>chose a very modern and colorful color scheme</strong> for NaySure.

Additionally, users did not notice but I did notice that the gardening activity had a gps/map feature but that adventure did not require one. Some other smaller decisions were made too, such as adding lines would make the map appear more interactive. I also noticed some wording changes that could be made. <br></div>

      <div class="text-block-7">Throughout this project, there were many things that came together quickly and easily. With user feedback, <strong>the branding and low fidelity wireframes felt like a breeze</strong>. User testing enlightened me to bugs such as<strong> some small hangups when linking prototype screens</strong> in InVision. Additionally, user testing showed <strong>confusion surrounding the “getting matched with a hobby” concept</strong>. In future projects, I will continue doing <strong>testing on my sketches</strong> with Marvel App if I have the opportunity. And I will continue <strong>listening to users, learning more about their needs, and focusing on them first</strong>.<br></div><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ajHESkkGQmpgy2c3dxLqLy9k/Photosphere?node-id=229%3A1150" class="link-block-2 w-inline-block"><img src="images/figma-button.png" alt="figma button" width="137" class="image-7 image-11"></a></div>
